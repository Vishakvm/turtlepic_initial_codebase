            1 selfie is all it takes to find any person's photos in your published event. Whether a
            guest is present in 1% of photos or 99%, it doesn't take more than a few seconds to
            filter their photos from the entire event

            TurtlePic Face recognition is very robust and offers more than 99% accuracy when finding
            your photos. It even finds you in blurry photos, large group photos, photos with the
            person's side faces and many more instances where you'd be blown away by AI's accuracy
            to find you.
